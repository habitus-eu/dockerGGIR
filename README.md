# dockerGGIR
In this repository I keep the code for building docker containers related to GGIR

### There are two docker images on Dockerhub:
- vvanhees/base-r-ggir:GGIR1.10-1, which has R base and GGIR
- vvanhees/ggir-default, which uses the beforementioned image to facilitate application of GGIR to data


Optionally started by deleting old images from docker hub, and removing all local images with docker rmi.

Build image with r-base and GGIR:

```
docker build --no-cache --force-rm --tag vvanhees/base-r-ggir:latest base-r-ggir/.
```

Start interactive contained to check that GGIR is installed:

```
docker run -it vvanhees/base-r-ggir bash
```

If yes, push to Dockerhub:

```
docker push vvanhees/base-r-ggir:latest
```

Build with R script to run GGIR from the beforementioned image:

```
docker build --no-cache --force-rm --tag vvanhees/ggir-default ggir-default/.
```

Push to Dockerhub:

```
docker push vvanhees/ggir-default
```


### To use the docker image ggir-default do:

The following instructions assume that you have Docker installed. For installation instructions, see [docs.docker](https://docs.docker.com/) -> Get Docker -> Docker Engine-Community for the open source community editions per operating system.
- Update the command below to specify data folder, this folder needs to contain accelerometer data files.
- The config.csv file can be produced with GGIR, an [example config.csv file](ggir-default/config.csv) is included in this repo. For more informaiton about how GGIR creates and uses config.csv files see the [package vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GGIR/vignettes/GGIR.html#configuration-file).
- The output folder needs to exist and should not be equal to or a sub-directory of the data folder.
- Add -d if you want to make it less verbose.


```
docker run -it --rm --name ggir-default \
--mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/data,target=/data \
--mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/config.csv,target=/config.csv \
--mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/output,target=/output,bind-propagation=rslave \
  vvanhees/ggir-default
```

Acknowledgment: Code inspired by [blog post](https://www.r-bloggers.com/running-your-r-script-in-docker/) by Oliver Guggenb√ºhl. I replaced the -v command with the --mount for mounting files and folders as I read elsewhere that that is best practise nowadays.

# dockerGGIR
In this repository I keep the code for building docker containers related to GGIR

### There are two docker images on Dockerhub:
- vvanhees/base-r-ggir:GGIR1.10-1, which has R base and GGIR
- vvanhees/ggir-default, which uses the beforementioned image to facilitate application of GGIR to data

Images were built and pushed to Dockerhub with following commands:

```

docker build --tag vvanhees/base-r-ggir:GGIR2.1.0 base-r-ggir/.
docker build --tag vvanhees/ggir-default:GGIR2.1.0 ggir-default/.
docker push vvanhees/base-r-ggir:GGIR2.1.0
docker push vvanhees/ggir-default:GGIR2.1.0
```


### To use the docker image ggir-default do:

The following instructions assume that you have Docker installed. For installation instructions, see [docs.docker](https://docs.docker.com/) -> Get Docker -> Docker Engine-Community for the open source community editions per operating system.
- Update the command below to specify data folder, this folder needs to contain accelerometer data files.
- The config.csv file can be produced with GGIR, an [example config.csv file](ggir-default/config.csv) is included in this repo. For more informaiton about how GGIR creates and uses config.csv files see the [package vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GGIR/vignettes/GGIR.html#configuration-file).
- The output folder needs to exist and should not be equal to or a sub-directory of the data folder.
- Add -d if you want to make it less verbose.

```
docker run -it --rm --name ggir-defaut \
--mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/data,target=/data \
--mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/config.csv,target=/config.csv \
--mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/output,target=/output,bind-propagation=rslave \
  vvanhees/ggir-default
```

Acknowledgment: Code inspired by [blog post](https://www.r-bloggers.com/running-your-r-script-in-docker/) by Oliver Guggenb√ºhl. I replaced the -v command with the --mount for mounting files and folders as I read elsewhere that that is best practise nowadays.
